# automated-image-sender
Sends a random image from an Imgur album to a Facebook friend, using the <a href="https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat">fbchat</a> module.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

Allows for automated image sending on facebook, preventing accidentally sending the same image twice, by using a dictionary for each person containing the imgur links and whether each has been sent.  

<h2>Future improvements</h2>

Define classes, change storage method.
